# Face Tracker
This project involves building an attendance system which utilizes facial recognition to mark the presence, date and in time of employees. It covers areas such as facial detection, alignment, and recognition, along with the development of a web application to cater to various use cases of the system such as marking attendance, viewing attendance reports, etc. This project intends to serve as an efficient substitute for traditional manual attendance systems. It can be used in corporate offices, schools, and organizations where security is essential.
